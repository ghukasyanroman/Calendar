# Calendar

This project is my final Python project for the Machine Learning and Data Science course at Armenian Code Academy. The main purpose was to create a small project using Python basics, OOP, and file exporting/importing.

## Overview

This project helps people keep track of their tasks on specific dates. Users specify the year when they start the application, and only that year will be used throughout the runtime. Tasks can be exported as a text file for future reference.

## Features

- **User Input**: Users specify the year, month and day when they want to assign a task.
- **Errors and Exceptions Handling**: The system handles leap years and the number of days in each month. It prompts the user to correct their input in case of invalid entries.
- **Export/Import**: If the user wishes, the system creates a text document where all tasks with their corresponding dates are stored. They can then import this document to view it in the terminal.

## Usage

To use the Calendar System, update the `file_path` variable with your preferred path. This path will be used to export the final text documents.

Thank you for using the Calendar System!
